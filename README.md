## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This portfolio follows a **hub-based navigation strategy** that respects visitor attention spans. Instead of endless scrolling, users choose their exploration path:

- **About Me** - The story behind the solutions *(2 min read)*
- **My Work** - 3 projects that solved real problems *(5 min explore)*  
- **My Skills** - How I combine tech to create impact *(1 min interactive)*
- **Contact Me** - Let's build something together *(30 sec)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 3.4+, Framer Motion 12+  
**Performance:** Lazy loading, code splitting, sub-2 second load times  
**Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, mobile-first responsive design  
**Animation:** Physics-based spring animations, 60 FPS performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akhil-Lokesh/portfolio2.o.git
